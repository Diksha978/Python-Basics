    "1. What is a RESTful API\n",
    "  -> A RESTful API (Representational State Transfer API) is a web service architecture that follows REST principles, using standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to interact with resources identified by URLs. It enables stateless client-server communication and is widely used in web and mobile applications due to its simplicity and scalability."

    "2. Explain the concept of API specification\n",
    "  -> API specification defines how software components interact, outlining the available endpoints, request/response formats, authentication methods, and expected behavior. It serves as a blueprint for developers to understand and implement API functionality, ensuring consistency and interoperability."

    "  -> Flask is a lightweight Python web framework known for its simplicity and flexibility. It allows developers to build web applications and APIs quickly, with minimal setup. Its modular design, built-in development server, and large ecosystem of extensions make it a popular choice for RESTful API development."

    "4. What is routing in Flask\n",
    "  -> Routing in Flask refers to the mapping of URLs to specific functions (view functions). When a user accesses a specific route, the associated function is executed. Flask uses the @app.route() decorator to define these routes, allowing developers to create custom paths and handle different HTTP methods."
