    "1. What is a RESTful API\n",
    "  -> A RESTful API (Representational State Transfer API) is a web service architecture that follows REST principles, using standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to interact with resources identified by URLs. It enables stateless client-server communication and is widely used in web and mobile applications due to its simplicity and scalability."
